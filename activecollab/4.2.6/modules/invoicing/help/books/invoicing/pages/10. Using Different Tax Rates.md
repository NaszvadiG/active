*Title: Using Different Tax Rates
*Slug: tax-rates

================================================================

It is possible to localize your Invoices for Clients from different countries by translating the invoices into their language, setting the appropriate currency and using tax rates applied in a particular country.

You can set as many different <{term}>Tax Rates<{/term}> as you wish and use them when needed. Open <{option}>Administration > Tax Rates<{/option}> and use the <{option}>New Tax Rate<{/option}> button.

All the available tax rates will be listed on this page. **Select the tax rate that you wish to use as default:**

On top of that, you can choose how to display taxes on the Invoice - either as rates or as amounts. You can choose one of these options in <{option}>Administration > Invoice Designer<{/option}> by opening <{option}>Body Settings<{/option}> and selecting how to display the columns on the Invoice.
