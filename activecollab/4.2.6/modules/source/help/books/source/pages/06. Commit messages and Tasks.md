*Title: Link Commit Messages with Tasks
*Slug: commit-messages-and-tasks

================================================================

activeCollab can also parse commit messages and connect them with Tasks related to a specific job.

Here's what you can do with your commit messages:

- **Link Commit with Tasks** - Simply add <{option}>Task #ID<{/option}> in a commit message. You will find the Task ID number in the Task title under the <{term}>#<{/term}> symbol. In case you have a few projects connected to the same repository, you should use <{option}>Task #ID@project-slug<{/option}> to make a difference between Tasks in separate projects.
- **Close Task with commit message**. Use <{option}>Complete Task #ID<{/option}> to mark a specific Task as completed.
- **Display commits in the Task that they are related to**. All commit messages related to a specific Task will be available in the Task information block. This way, you will be able to track code related to this Task easily.
